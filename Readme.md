# Logistics-Supplychain

Problem we are trying to solve:
Tempering of the expiry date in the edible products and trying to overcome the problem of grey-market product selling.

Solution we provided:
A blockchain based Supply Chain Management where we will be assigning the UID to all the products that are manufactured!, in the form of QR Code. At each increasing level of supply chain we will be scanning the UID assigned, and assure the quality assurance and presence of the product at that level.This can help us identify if the product received at that particular level, if found damaged, we can look in the problems arrived in the transportation in the previous level.If the product is missing, then that UID will be absent in scanning in that level indicating that product was misplaced in between the prev and present level, enchancing transparency and quality. With blochain getting integrated, the UID will be containing the self-life of the product, which cant be tempered, hence enchancing quality and customer satisfaction, as customers can scan the UID and get information about the products.
